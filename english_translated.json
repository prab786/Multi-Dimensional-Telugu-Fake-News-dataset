This order does not mention rules if a national party with a regional party having the same symbol wants to contest. Regarding party symbols, according to Para 9 (b), even if any new party meets the conditions for state party recognition mentioned in Para 6A, a symbol allotted to a state party cannot be given to another party in a different state. However, if before the 1997 amendment a political party has reserved its symbol, and the same symbol is also reserved for state parties in other states, the rule mentioned in clause (b) does not apply to that party.

In 2007, several news agencies reported an incident where some Hyderabad city residents walked on cow dung arranged in a cowshed believing that walking on cow dung reduces diabetes. However, doctors responded to this incident at that time saying there is no scientific evidence for the medicinal properties of cow dung and all this seems like comedy to them.
